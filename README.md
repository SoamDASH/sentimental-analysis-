# sentimental-analysis-

In this project, I used BERT and NLTK to perform sentimental analysis on Facebook chats. The results of the analysis were visualized using 3D charts to provide neutral sentiments.



Additionally, I also implemented a feature to rotate the 3D chart for a better understanding of the data.



Overall, this project demonstrates the power Of BERT and NLTK in sentiment analysis and how it can be applied to social media platforms like Facebook



Additionally, this method can also be applied to analyzing feedback on a company's products by analyzing comments on the company's Facebook posts. The feed descriptions can also be analyzed to gain insights into customer sentiment toward the company's products.



Furthermore, this method can be used to analyze the activity within a specific Facebook group by identifying the presence of positive or negative words. This can provide insights on the intent and sentiment of the group, such as detecting potential instances of hate speech or calls for violence.
